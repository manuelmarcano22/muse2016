### The server

The HP computer was set up so I can connect to the server via ssh to the computer *kerr.cesr.fr*. 

At first I will begin working with the computer of a previous Dr. Webb student. TO connect use:

```bash
ssh -X detoeuf@kerr.cesr.fr
```

The password was given by Dr. Webb. Can use **ds9** to visualize the server.

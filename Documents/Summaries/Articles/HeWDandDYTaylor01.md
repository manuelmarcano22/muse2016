#[Helium White Dwarfs and BY Draconis Binaries in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397][@taylor01]


## Abstract

In an H $\alpha$ survey found some NFs and also some weak emission characteristic of BY Draconis stars. They might be binaries since they are off set from the Main Sequence and also more central.

## Intro

Three more nonflickerers due to their H $\alpha$ absorption and blue color. With H$\alpha$ vs R. 

Also foundfor the first time a population of binaries BY Draconis. These are weaker H$\alpha$ emitter objects. They are fast rotators and since in globular cluster the rotation of these binaries is locked this help us understand hard binaries population.

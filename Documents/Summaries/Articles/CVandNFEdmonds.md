First present CV4 and new evidence that these are DQ Her systems. CV4 might be an dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Also present the spectra of a nonflickerers (NFs). From stellar atmosphere models it is of mass 0.35 Solar Mass He WD. The Doppler shift suggest a dark massive companion, probably a Carbon-Oxygen (CO) WD. 


They could be dwarf Novae but their He II 4686 A line is unusually strong for DNe. They argue CV1-3 magnetics (or old novae) and CV4 is low accretion-rate DN or magnetic CV. Unlikely to be LMXB due to comparison of X-ray properties.   

Also study the NF. These are unlikely to be "normal" CO WDs (evolved from sngle red giants), extented Horizontal Branch or field stars. They are candidate for low-mass helium WDs.

There are usually found in binaries. For example a red giant/WD or MS/red giant would give a He WD. They present first spectra.  

CV1: 

1. The brightest one and very close to the MS so very bright secondary and faint disk. So much is secondary. In DQ also less accretion disk due to magnetic fields
2. Period 5.1 hours

CV4:
1. Less wide lines. Not big HeII. This is outside of MUSE range. 
2. Period of 3.6 hours. 

"secondaries in CVs with orbital period below 7 hours" are typically not evolved. 

About he NF:

1. The broad H$\beta$ line indicates that is a massive object. 

In discussion they say that the interpretation of CV1 compared to field CV is that is either a faint or cool disk due to low accretion or a WD with moderately strong magnetic field. The use line ratio of He II to $H \beta$ as signature of magnetic systems.

That is why due to weak HeII and faint disk, CV4   might be a DN system. 

For CV1-3 they have strong emission of HeII. Not as large as AM Her types. Weaker also than DQ Her systems but there exist an spread. They could be DQ Her type.  

By examining the correlation between continuum and line ratios they conclude that maybe all are DQ Hers systems. But also maybe old novae. They can be both.  

## About the NF

Probably it is not due to ejected velocity because it would be already well outside core. The usually have companion and maybe Neutron star companion but nothing found yet. No MS due to photometry. 

## Conlusions

Maybe these difference in population of fields and Globular cluster CVs is that stars rotate faster after interaction and have more magnetic fields. 

For the NF: Mass of 0.25 Solar Mass and how old depend on the model. Also say that is more efficient to create He WD with interaction between degenerate stars and subgiants or faint red giantas than interaction with brighter red giants.

Observed in 1996 NGC 6397 with Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 1. Found a distinct class of faint UV stars in the cluster. They called them nonflickereres (NFs) "because the rms variations in the light curves of these stars are typical of other nonvariables stars of similar apparent magnitude", but they were also bluer than Main Sequence stars. 

They are  outside of error cycle of ROSAT, unlike, for example, the CV1-4. It was suggested that they were "extended horizontal-branch" (EHB) stars. EHB stars are thought to be core-helium-burning stars with unusually thin hydrogen envelopes, but they are expected to be brighter than the NFs. And NGC shows no sign of "blue horizontal-brahcn extension".  

They propose that they are: "low-mass helium white dwarfs". Masses beloe 0.4-0.4 mass of Sun. Using the model of [Althaus and Benvenuto][@modelAB] the mass is about 0.25 Solar Mass. 

How to get these object? They say:

> To form a He WD, the envelope of a red giant branch star must be removed.

And they propose two mechanism:

1. Roche love overflow onto a binary companion.
2. Collision producing a common envelope system , followed by envelope ejection. 

Both are post-sequence evolution. and this by me linked to the deficit of of Red Giant Branch (RGB) in the cluster center. Dont know if primordial or via collision formed binaries. Companion of with a Mass higher than 0.15 solar mass are ruled out, but fainter MS stars, cool WD and neutron stars are allowed and would be a natural remainder.   

Like bright blue stragglers, both CVs and NFs are strongly concentrated towards the cluster center. This is expected with mass segregation. All within 16". But this is too much so either they are heavier than expected or also other process besides mass segregation at work. They say:

> This strong central concentration is evidence that the formation is linked to stellar interactions which are favor within 5" of cluster center.
